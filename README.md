A Minecraft Bedrock Vibrant Visuals resource pack that outlines and glows ores with their block color, with optional x-ray. Fluoroscopy is designed around the [new Bedrock Textures](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/try-new-bedrock-textures) to match vanilla as much as possible.

There are three settings to choose from, each providing a different level of visibility for ores:

> [!WARNING]
> Settings other than **Outline** require [Vibrant Visuals](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/vibrant-visuals-update) to be enabled.

- **Outline**: Outlines ores with their block color.
- **Outline and Glow (default)**: Outlines ores with their block color and adds a glow effect.
- **Outline, Glow, and X-ray**: Outlines ores with their block color, adds a glow effect, and makes all non-ore blocks invisible.

Each of the three settings can be seen below in both the Overworld and The Nether:

## Comparisons
